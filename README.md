##Survey Gorilla
Survey Gorilla allows users to create and administer surveys in order to collect data.  Once creeated, surveys may be taken by any users.  The cummulative results of each survey are then viewable via rich visual charts.

##Our Process
Our kanban board was hosted on Trello.  It may be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/MTC0lKyt/survey-gorilla).

##App Design
Our mockups/wireframes may be viewed [here](TBD).

##Development
Team Gorilla utilizes a streamlined agile process based on the Kanban system (see Our Process above).  To ensure proper git hygiene, we utilized the [Steven G. Harms Enhanced Rebase Optimized Team Enabled Git Workflow](https://github.com/nyc-mud-turtles-2015/phase-2-guide/blob/nyc/resources/git_workflow.md).
